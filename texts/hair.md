# Hair {

Hair is mostly made up of the protein keratin,

which is responsible for the forming of hair, skin, and nails.

## Keratin {

- Can exist as alpha-keratin (which forms hair, skin, and nails in humans) and beta-keratin (which forms nails/claws in reptiles or birds).
- Mainly composed of leucine, arganine, and cysteine, amino acids that comes from protein-rich foods. (meats, fish, eggs, dairy, poultry)
- Are an intermediate filament, which means they make up the structure of cells.
- Greatly depend on sulfur to protect against oxidative stress

Keratin deficiency (low keratin) can result in dry or flaky skin, breakage and split ends in hair, hair with high porosity (absorbs water quickly), and brittle nails.

Keratin deficiency is caused by poor diet, pollution, and UV exposure.

- Poor diet (specifically proteins) decreases the synthesis of keratin by decreasing the production of amino acids that come from protein-rich foods.
- Particles in polluted air decrease antioxidants in the body, which reduce the amount of free radicals (unstable molecules that are highly reactive due to unpaired electrons), leading to decreased synthesis of keratin due to oxidative stress. (an imbalance of free radicals and antioxidants where free radicals harm cells by reacting with them)
- UV exposure increases Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in the body, a type of free radical.

## How to fight keratin deficiency:

- Protein-rich & dairy foods increase the amino acids leucine, arganine, and cysteine, who make up a large part of the keratin protein.
- Fruits & vegetables increase antioxidants in the body, which stops free radical molecules from harming keratin cells by reacting with them.
- Sulfur-based hair products fight against oxidative stress, protecting your hair against free radicals.
- Silk bonnets and pillowcases help reduce friction-induced hair breakage and frizz, as well as the fact that silk is made of keratin as well as other fibrous proteins.
