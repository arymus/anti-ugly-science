# Anti Ugly Science
All the things that make me feel unattractive, explained by science (and how to fix it)

## Why?
I really, REALLY like biology, and it's also fun to explore how my insecurities developed scientifically (so I can fix them)

## Goal
I want to feel better about myself and learn more about biology (part of the [Summer Learning Roadmap](https://github.com/arymus/summer-learning-roadmap))
